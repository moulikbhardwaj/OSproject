This text file holds the information about non preemptive sjf scheduling method.
In this method, we order jobs in such a way that the job with shortest burst time will be executed first.
Being preemptive, if a job with shorter burst time comes than the one currently executing, execution will stop,and new job start executing immidiately, i.e. context switching can occour at arrival of new job.

This type of scheduling can cause starvation.

Implementation:
We can Implementat nonpreemptive sjf scheduled by sorting the input queue in order of their burst time, and execute them one by one, or maintain a min-heap/priority queue, for the processes, and add to it the processes. The front element of min-heap will give the job to be executed next.
Complexity: O(Nlog(N))
