This text file holds the information about non preemptive sjf scheduling method.
In this method, we order jobs in such a way that the job with shortest burst time will be executed first.
Being non preemptive, if a job with shorter burst time comes than the one currently executing, execution will not stop,and next job will be scheduled only after the completion of current job.

This type of scheduling can cause starvation.

Implementation:
We can Implementat nonpreemptive sjf scheduled by sorting the input queue in order of their burst time, and execute them one by one.
Complexity: O(Nlog(N))
