This text file holds the information about First Come First Serve scheduling method.
In this method, we order jobs in such a way that the job that came earlier will be executed first.
It is the easiest and simplest CPU scheduling algorithm.
This is a non-preemptive type of scheduling.

Implementation:
We can implement FCFS easily, by sorting the input queue by the order of their arrival time, and then execute them one by one.
If the tasks come in order of arrival time, then the running time is O(N), else, we need to sort them, making runtime of O(N*(log(N)))
